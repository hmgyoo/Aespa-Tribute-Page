        aespa is a name created by combining the "æ" that expresses "Avatar X Experience" and the English word "aspect", which means double-sided. 
        SM ENTERTAINMENT's new girl group is expected to have innovative and diverse activities based on the worldview of "meeting 
        your avatar, your other ego, and experiencing a new world." The members of "aespa" in the real world link each other through
        the avatar "ae-aespa", which is the "other self" of the virtual world, through "SYNK". Their names are "ae-KARINA", 
        "ae-WINTER", "ae-GISELLE" and "ae-NINGNING".
